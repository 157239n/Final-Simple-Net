# Final Simple Net

This is a very old attempt of mine to create a DL framework from scratch in Java to learn MNIST, because I didn't understand how backprop works. I now know how it works and have been using PyTorch regularly, but still don't quite believe they work so well.

Anyway, this is still public because it was a major attempt back then, when I dabbled with multithreading and whatnot.
